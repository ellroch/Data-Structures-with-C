testing the program:
  there were not many input requests so teting should be pretty simple

  input requests:
      Starting Node:
          expected input: integer between 1-17
          output cases:
            integer less than 1:     "ERROR: Your selection was invalid, please select a value between 1 and 17"
            integer greater than 17: "ERROR: Your selection was invalid, please select a value between 1 and 17"
            alternative data type:   "ERROR: Your selection was invalid, please select a value between 1 and 17"

          corrective action taken:
            clear the broken state of the cin function so that it will take input again
            clear the buffer for the next 100 characters to prevent erronious input on the next call

      Ending Node:
          expected input: integer between 1-17
          output cases:
            integer less than 1:     "ERROR: Your selection was invalid, please select a value between 1 and 17"
            integer greater than 17: "ERROR: Your selection was invalid, please select a value between 1 and 17"
            alternative data type:   "ERROR: Your selection was invalid, please select a value between 1 and 17"
            Ending value matches starting value:"ERROR: Your destination and your starting point are the same. Please select a distinct destination."

          corrective action taken:
            clear the broken state of the cin function so that it will take input again
            clear the buffer for the next 100 characters to prevent erronious input on the next call
